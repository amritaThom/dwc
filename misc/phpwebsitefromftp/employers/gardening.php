		"I have hired workers from the center at least monthly for more than 10 years.
	     I have never had a single problem with anyone and I do not worry about them coming
		  in my yard or in my home.
		 All the workers have been courteous and appreciative of the chance to work.
		 I have hired workers to garden, dig holes, spread mulch, pull weeds,, paint,
		  clean sweep, pick up branches, move heavy items, patch plaster, split wood, etc.
		 Maria runs the Center in a very professional way and they always call me back to see
		  if I was satisfied."
