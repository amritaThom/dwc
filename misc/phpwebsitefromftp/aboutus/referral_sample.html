<p><strong>Sample Text:</strong> I recently used the Day Worker Center of Mountain View for help around the home. &nbsp;I was impressed by the quality of work and the inexpensive pricing. &nbsp;It was easy to schedule too. Call (650) 903-4102 or simply drop into the Center at 113 Escuela Ave. in Mountain View to get workers on the spot from 7am-5pm Monday through Saturday. </p>
<p>The Day Worker Center is a 501C3 non-profit organization established in 1996 by leaders from local businesses, churches, and the community to provide job-matching services for homeowners and businesses. The DWC helps employers find reliable workers, while empowering workers through education, advocacy, and job-skills training. Workers usually perform yard work, house cleaning, child care, and moving, but also tasks such as construction, painting, plumbing, electrical work, cooking, and sewing. </p>
