  <p>The Center provides an amazing array of services and programs and needs your support to continue them. The Center is also in the process of moving to a new location and very much needs new funds. </p>
  <p>Please mail your check to:<br />
    Day Worker Center of Mountain View<br />
    748 Mercy Street, Mountain View, CA 94041</p>
  <p>The Day Worker Center of Mountain View is a 501(c)3 non-profit and is primarily funded by grants from organizations such as the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, Philanthropic Ventures Foundation, the Mountain View Voice, and the Catholic Campaign For Human Development (just to name a few). </p>
  <p>The Center currently receives very modest support from the local municipalities, but that may be changing. You can help by encouraging your city council (Mountain View, Los Altos, Palo Alto, and Sunnyvale) to start or increase their financial support to the Center.</p>
  <p>Coming soon:  Online credit card donation system!</p>
