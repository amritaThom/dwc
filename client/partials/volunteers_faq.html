	<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <p><strong>Is there a minimum amount of time that is required from volunteers?</strong><br />
    No. Each project or role is different and we can usually make things work to fit your schedule or desired level of commitment.</p>
  <p><strong>Do I need to speak Spanish in order to volunteer at the Center?</strong><br />
    No. Many volunteers speak little or no Spanish. While speaking Spanish definitely helps, it is not required. And if you do speak a little Spanish, the Center is a great place to practice and improve.</p>
  <p><strong>Since some of the workers at the center may not be in this country legally, could I get in trouble just for volunteering at the Center?</strong><br />
    No. We are an officially recognized 501c3 non-profit organization. We do notâ€”nor are we required toâ€”check the immigration status of any of the workers, employers, or volunteers.</p>
  <p><strong>What kind of jobs are there for volunteers at the Center?</strong><br />
   The <a href="#/opportunities">Opportunities</a> page is the best place to learn more about this.</p>
