	<h2>Volunteer</h2>
  <p>Volunteering at the Day Workers' Center is fun and rewarding. We have a wide range of opportunities at the Center. When you give your time to the DWCMV, you are investing in a stronger community and in the lives of people who are working to do their part for their families and neighborhood. Volunteering enables you to witness the difference you are making and be a conduit for positive change. Check the <a href="#/opportunities">Opportunities</a> page to see how you can get involved.</p>
  <p>You can work as little or as much as your schedule allows, but, be careful - volunteering at the Center can be addicting! 
     Check our <a href="#/volunteers/success_stories">Success Stories</a> to see what we mean. </p>
  <p>Interested? If so, please fill out the simple <a href="#/signup">Volunteer Sign-up Form</a> and
      we'll be in touch soon.</p>
