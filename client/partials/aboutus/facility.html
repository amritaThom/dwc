				<h2>Facility</h2>
				<p><img class="facility" src="../images/img_left_on_facility.jpg" alt="[DWC Facility picture]" align="right" />Our worker-maintained facility is centered around a large multi-purpose room, where we hold weekly worker meetings, classes, and events. Volunteer-led classes include instruction in English as a Second Language (ESL), high school equivalency (GED), computers, blogging, music, sewing, cooking, canning, green housecleaning, CPR, and after-school tutoring programs for kids.</p> 
				<p>The DWCMV currently receives support for operations from a combination of foundation and private donor support, as well as receiving significant in-kind services from cooperating agencies (see our <a href="#/aboutus/partners">Partners</a> page for more information). In our permanent location, the DWCMV saves on rental costs and enjoys stable, efficient operations in a facility suited to its needs and purposes.</p>
				<p>IN 2008, The DWCMV was able to purchase our property at 113 Escuela Avenue in Mountain View thanks to the generous support of the community. After a successful capital campaign, we were thrilled to move in to our fully remodeled community center. The single-story 3,496 square foot warehouse has been upgraded to include new electrical and heating/ventilation systems, kitchen, bathrooms, patio area, and roof.</p>
