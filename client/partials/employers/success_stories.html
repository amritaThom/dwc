		<h2>Success Stories</h2>
		<p><em>"I have hired workers from the Day Worker Center for over ten years and have never had any problems. Everyone has been courteous, hard working and trustworthy.  The workers have done some very hard jobs, like splitting wood, and difficult and dirty jobs, like helping my husband insulate under the  house, with no complaints and only appreciation for the opportunity to work.</p>

		<p>"I have also become good friends with one worker and his wife and daughter and we have done many things to help each other's families. I have relearned that we all want the same things in our lives, to be able to work and take care of ourselves and our families."</em></p>
		
		<p>Our workers have helped out in backyards, construction sites, community events (like the Art &amp; Wine Festival), homes (as maids, cooks, and child-care givers), community gardens, and more. And the <a href="#/employers/services">list of tasks they can perform is even longer</a>.</p>
