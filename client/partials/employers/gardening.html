				<h3>Gardening Services</h3>
				<p>The Day Worker Center of Mountain View offers you same-day, reliable, safe gardeners for any gardening/yard work job, large or small, including yard cleanup, planting, garden maintenance, picking fruit, and cleaning gutters. Employers provide the gardening supplies and equipment.</p>
				<br />
				<div class="testimonial">
					<p><em>"I have hired workers from the center at least monthly for more than 10 years. I have never had a single problem with anyone and I do not worry about them coming in my yard or in my home. All the workers have been courteous and appreciative of the chance to work. I have hired workers to garden, dig holes, spread mulch, pull weeds, paint, clean, sweep, pick up branches, move heavy items, patch plaster, split wood, etc. Maria runs the Center in a very professional way and they always call me back to see if I was satisfied."</em></p>
