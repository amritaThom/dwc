				<p><em>"I have hired workers from the Day Worker Center for over ten years and have never had any problems. Everyone has been courteous, hard working and trustworthy. The workers have done some very hard jobs, like splitting wood, and difficult and dirty jobs, like helping my husband insulate under the  house, with no complaints and only appreciation for the opportunity to work." &mdash; Patricia</em></p>
